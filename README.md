### Introduction:
The provided code demonstrates a weather prediction application developed using React. The prediction is based on a Markov chain model, which utilizes the concept of transition probabilities between weather states to forecast the weather for a specified number of days. This essay will delve into the implementation details, highlighting the use of Markov chains in the prediction algorithm.

### Implementation Details:
The App component serves as the main entry point for the weather prediction application. It utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of the forecasted weather, the number of days to predict, and the initial data fetching. The Card component is also imported for displaying the weather predictions.

### Weather Prediction Algorithm:
The key aspect of the weather prediction logic lies within the utilization of a Markov chain model. Markov chains are stochastic models that describe a sequence of events where the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends solely on the current state. In the context of weather prediction, each weather state represents a particular weather condition, such as "Cloudy," "Sunny," "Rain," or "Snow."

The predictWeather function plays a crucial role in generating the forecasted weather. It starts by defining the weather states and the transition probabilities between them using a transition matrix. The transition matrix specifies the likelihood of transitioning from one weather state to another. The transition probabilities are pre-defined based on domain knowledge or historical data.

Starting from a random initial state, the function predicts the weather for the specified number of days by repeatedly calling the predictNextState function. This function takes the current weather state and the transition matrix as input. It calculates the cumulative probabilities for transitioning to each possible state based on the provided transition matrix.

By generating a random number between 0 and 1, the predictNextState function determines the next weather state by comparing the cumulative probabilities with the random number. This process allows for the simulation of weather conditions that exhibit similar statistical patterns observed in the transition matrix.

### User Interface:
The user interface allows users to specify the number of days they want to predict the weather for. It consists of an input field where users can enter the desired number of days, a "Predict" button, and a display area for showing the predicted weather.

Upon entering a valid number of days and clicking the "Predict" button, the predictWeather function is invoked to generate the forecasted weather. The resulting weather predictions are then rendered using the Card component, with each card displaying the predicted weather for a specific day.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the provided code showcases a weather prediction application implemented using React, leveraging the power of Markov chains. By utilizing transition probabilities between weather states, the application forecasts the weather for the specified number of days. The use of Markov chains allows for the modeling of weather patterns and the simulation of realistic weather conditions. This project demonstrates the integration of state management, user interface elements, and the Markov chain concept to deliver an interactive and informative weather prediction experience.
